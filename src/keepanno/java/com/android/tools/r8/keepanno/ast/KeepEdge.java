/**
 * An edge in the keep graph.
 *
 * <p>An edge describes a set of preconditions and a set of consequences. If the preconditions are
 * met, then the consequences are put into effect.
 *
 * <p>Below is a BNF of the keep edge AST for reference. The non-terminals are written in ALL_CAPS,
 * possibly-empty repeatable subexpressions denoted with SUB* and non-empty with SUB+
 *
 * <p>In the Java AST, the non-terminals are prefixed with 'Keep' and in CamelCase.
 *
 * <p>TODO(b/248408342): Update the BNF and AST to be complete.
 *
 * <pre>
